All but the lights between the Psyc building and Myerhoff had gone dark. Not a soul was in sight, but the winds still howled through the buildings like a wind tunnel that we all knew so well.</p><p>A 421 student, having just recompiled his kernel for the 16<sup>th</sup> time, wandered out of the doors of the Engineering building. Was it the middle of the night? Or would dawn soon come? No matter, he trudged on hoping that he could soon find his bed and forget about the endless frustration he has endured.</p><p>He hopped down the steps towards Sondheim. One. Two. Three. Five. His balance was off. His conscience was falling, falling, falling. Seven. Eleven. Twelve. Lighter and lighter his steps got until finally he was weightless – falling – and suddenly, pulled back like a rubber band, he hit ground.</p><p>To his left was the Chick fil A. To his right were the picnic tables. Picking himself back up for another round of stairs, the student trudges on. But as he moves, a shadowy figure hovers over the tables. Unaware, the student trudges on. That shadowy figure multiplies. One table. Two tables. Three Tables. A sea of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Twenty</strong></span> shadowy figuresswarms the tables leaving a sight impossible to ignore. The unexpected sight catches the corner of the student’s eye.</p><p>The figures, in unison, stop and turn towards the student. The student looks at the figures. In disbelief, the student turns around in the other direction, towards the restaurant once open, now closed. The student turns back once more to confirm that this wasn’t just his tired imagination…</p><p>… To face an attack swarm of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">twenty</span></strong> hungry demons devoid of waffle fries and Polynesian sauce</p></div><aside><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 21, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://catacombs.wonder-tag.online/authors/anonymous/" class="inverse" title="anonymous">anonymous</a></h3></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://catacombs.wonder-tag.online/strange-moans-from-locker-28.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Strange Moans from Locker 28</a></h3></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://catacombs.wonder-tag.online/math-students-disappearing-after-supposed-trips-to-the-bathroom.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Math Students Disappearing after supposed &quot;trips to the bathroom&quot;</a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>emphasized</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> text</span> </strong>definitely doesn't mean anything.
