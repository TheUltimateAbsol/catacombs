Math/Psyc building restrooms are put under maintenance. An announcement is put on the myUMBC website.</p><p>4/21/2022, 1:00 PM. Alice is seen running away from the 104 classroom. Seemingly unaware of the announcement, she walks towards the Math building bathroom. It is locked. She walks down the stairs to the lower level to cross over to the Psyc building. However, footage of the Psyc building shows no signs of Alice.</p><p>4/21/2022, 8:15 PM. A search party of 7 is sent to find Alice.</p><p>4/21/2022, 9:15 PM. Still no contact from the search party.</p><p>4/22/2022, 3:02 AM. I receive a phone call from one of the search party members. However, it is cut off before I can answer.</p><p>4/22/2022, 7:00 AM. A heavy thunderstorm rolls in. Students are encouraged to stay indoors.</p><p>4/22/2022, 9:50 AM.  4 students leave room MATH 102 and walk towards the Psyc building. Teacher reports these students missing on the attendance sheet.</p><p>4/22/2022, 12:15 PM. The JSA holds their weekly board meeting in room 015 of Sondheim. 8 of their regular members are missing, and the meeting is canceled.</p><p>4/22/2022, 3:12 PM. The storm has escalated to a Tornado Warning. Students are dismissed early from their classes</p><p>4/22/2022, 4:00 PM. Reports of a Tornado touchdown near i-95 surface. An emergency siren goes off around campus, and students are told to immediately shelter in place.</p><p>4/22/2022, 4:02 PM. A group of ten students rush underground in the space between the Math/Psyc and Sonheim buildings to take cover</p><p>4/22/2022, 4:15 PM. The storm starts to subside. The shelter-in-place order is rescinded.</p><p>4/22/2022, 5:03 PM. The 10 students who sought shelter are still nowhere to be found.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>30</strong></span> students have gone missing in the past 48 hours. I cannot explain why. It seems that the root cause lies underground between the Math/Psyc and Sonheim buildings.</p></div><aside><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 21, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://catacombs.wonder-tag.online/authors/anonymous/" class="inverse" title="anonymous">anonymous</a></h3></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://catacombs.wonder-tag.online/demon-sighting-on-engineering-building-steps.html" class="inverse" rel="prev">Demon Sighting on Engineering Building Steps</a></h3></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://catacombs.wonder-tag.online/ancient-vending-machine-discovered-stocked-with-pepsi.html" class="inverse" rel="next">Ancient Vending Machine discovered; stocked with Pepsi</a></h3></div></nav></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>emphasized</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> text</span> </strong>definitely doesn't mean anything.
